# Hanwritten-Digit-Recognition
Handwritten Digit Recognition using MNIST dataset 
This project uses the MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 training photos and 10,000 testing images of digits spanning from 0 to 9, to develop a machine learning model for handwritten digit recognition. The model's high digit categorization accuracy is achieved by utilizing a variety of machine learning approaches, using machine learning. The project is divided into multiple sections, including model training, evaluation, and data preprocessing.
